# Trying GAP in a Jupyter notebook

This repository allows to try GAP in a Jupyter notebook. It does not require to
have a local GAP installation. Instead, it allows to use a browser to access a
remote GAP installation running on Binder (<https://mybinder.org/>).

To start a new GAP session, perform the following steps:

1. Click on the "launch binder" badge in this README file on GitHub, or open
<https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter/master> in the browser.

2. A message `Loading repository: gap-system/try-gap-in-jupyter/master` will be 
displayed, followed by a non-interactive preview. Please be patient, since it
may take a while, depending on the current load on Binder. When the server
will be ready, you will see the main Jupyter screen with a file browser.

3. Click on the `NewNotebook.ipynb` file to start GAP Jupyter notebook.

Please note that the notebook will not be preserved after the window will
be closed, but you will be able to download the notebook in various formats.
